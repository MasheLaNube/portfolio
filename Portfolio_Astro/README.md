# Astronomy Portfolio Projects (Python Basics)

This repository contains basic Python scripts with astronomy-themed examples, developed as part of a Fullstack programming course.

## Contents

1. **Unit Converter (Usa POO)**: Convert between parsecs, light years, AU, km, and solar radii. 
2. **Star Classifier**: Classify a star's spectral type based on temperature.
3. **Exoplanet Log (Usa POO)**: Record discovered exoplanets and saves information for future writing.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Variables, operators, conditionals, loops
- Data types: strings, integers, floats, booleans
- Lists, dictionaries, and CSV file handling
- Functions and modularization
- Console input/output
- Git and GitHub version control
- Usage of OOP


## How to Run
Most of them can be used via bash, however, the *Unity_conv* and *exo_log* are modules, so the need to be imported in the code you want to use. Inside each folder there is a readme with the functions.
